# üëã Hi, I'm Omar Arbi

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Master‚Äôs student in **Applied Mathematics and Data Science** at CentraleSup√©lec, also pursuing a research Master's in Mathematics, Vision, and Learning (MVA) at ENS Paris Saclay. With a foundation in applied mathematics and data science, I specialize in advanced machine learning applications, particularly in time series analysis, natural language processing, and distributed optimization.

I am passionate about using data science and machine learning to tackle real-world problems, ranging from time series forecasting to natural language processing.

## üîç What You'll Find Here

- **üîß Skills**: Python, SQL, MATLAB, Sklearn, Plotly, Pandas, Spark, Docker
- **Languages**: Fluent in Arabic, English, and French
- **Interest Areas**: Machine Learning for Time Series, Text Analysis, Graph Data, Large-Scale Optimization, Large Language Models, Multimodal models

## üìÇ Labs and Coursework Projects

Explore my lab work from different courses in my Master‚Äôs program. Each folder contains detailed projects applying advanced machine learning concepts:

- [**Advanced Machine Learning**](https://github.com/Omar-Ar1/Advanced-Machine-Learning): In-depth labs covering various machine learning models and applications.
- [**Advanced Learning for Text and Graph Data**](https://github.com/Omar-Ar1/Advanced-Learning-Text-Graph): Projects exploring NLP and graph data structures for enriched data learning.
- [**Large Distributed Optimization and Computing**](https://github.com/Omar-Ar1/Distributed-Optimization): Labs focused on optimization algorithms.

## üöß Work in Progress

I am currently involved in an exciting project that pushes the boundaries of machine learning:

- **Large Language Model for Investor Engagement**: In collaboration with BNP Asset Management, I am developing a specialized large language model (LLM) designed to explain optimization model results in a way that is accessible and engaging for investors. This project aims to bridge the gap between complex model outputs and investor insights.
