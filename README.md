# üëã Hi, I'm Omar Arbi

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Master‚Äôs student in **Applied Mathematics and Data Science** at CentraleSup√©lec, also pursuing an MVA (Mathematics, Vision, and Learning) Master‚Äôs at ENS Paris Saclay. With a foundation in quantitative trading, and data science, I specialize in advanced machine learning applications, particularly in time series analysis, natural language processing, and distributed optimization.

I am passionate about using data science and machine learning to tackle real-world problems, ranging from predictive trading strategies in the energy markets to well-being prediction in healthcare.

## üìä Personal Projects

I actively work on various data science and machine learning projects, applying diverse techniques to solve practical challenges. Here are some highlights:

- [**Energy Consumption Prediction**](https://github.com/Omar-Ar1/Quant-Finance-Data-Science/blob/main/Energy_Consumption_Forecast_advanced.ipynb): An XGBoost-powered model for accurately forecasting energy consumption. This project focuses on feature engineering and preprocessing to enhance model performance for proactive energy management.
- [**Stock Prediction with LSTM**](https://github.com/Omar-Ar1/Quant-Finance-Data-Science/blob/main/Stock%20Price%20Prediction%20LSTM.ipynb): A deep learning model utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict stock price movements. The model is trained on historical stock data to capture temporal dependencies and trends in financial markets.
- [**Image Classification with Ensemble Methods**](https://github.com/Omar-Ar1/Satellite_Image_Classification.ipynb): An image classification model leveraging ensemble techniques (e.g., Random Forest, Bagging, and Boosting) to improve accuracy. This project combines multiple models to create a robust classifier that enhances performance over individual models.
- [**Sentiment Analysis of Amazon User Reviews**](https://github.com/Omar-Ar1/Quant-Finance-Data-Science/blob/main/Amazon%20Reviews%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb): A natural language processing (NLP) project to analyze sentiment in Amazon customer reviews. This model uses a combination of text processing techniques to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative, offering insights into customer satisfaction and product performance.

## üöß Work in Progress

I am currently involved in two exciting projects that push the boundaries of machine learning and optimization:

- **Large Language Model for Investor Engagement**: In collaboration with BNP Asset Management, I am developing a specialized large language model (LLM) designed to explain optimization model results in a way that is accessible and engaging for investors. This project aims to bridge the gap between complex model outputs and investor insights.
  
- **Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) Enhancement**: I am conducting research to enhance the PPCA model, with a focus on refining its performance and applicability in high-dimensional data contexts. This involves exploring new techniques for dimensionality reduction and optimization within PPCA.
