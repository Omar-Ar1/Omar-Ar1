# 👋 Hi, I'm Omar Arbi

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Master’s student in **Applied Mathematics and Data Science** at CentraleSupélec, also pursuing an MVA (Mathematics, Vision, and Learning) Master’s at ENS Paris Saclay. With a foundation in quantitative trading, and data science, I specialize in advanced machine learning applications, particularly in time series analysis, natural language processing, and distributed optimization.

I am passionate about using data science and machine learning to tackle real-world problems, ranging from time series forecasting to natural language processing.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

- **🔧 Skills**: Python, SQL, MATLAB, Sklearn, Plotly, Pandas, Spark, Docker
- **Languages**: Fluent in Arabic, English, and French
- **Interest Areas**: Machine Learning for Time Series, Text Analysis, Graph Data, Large-Scale Optimization, Financial Modeling

## 📂 Labs and Coursework Projects

Explore my lab work from different courses in my Master’s program. Each folder contains detailed projects applying advanced machine learning concepts:

- [**Advanced Machine Learning**](https://github.com/Omar-Ar1/Advanced-Machine-Learning): In-depth labs covering various machine learning models and applications.
- [**Advanced Learning for Text and Graph Data**](https://github.com/Omar-Ar1/Advanced-Learning-Text-Graph): Projects exploring NLP and graph data structures for enriched data learning.
- [**Large Distributed Optimization and Computing**](https://github.com/Omar-Ar1/Distributed-Optimization): Labs focused on scaling machine learning algorithms for large datasets and distributed systems.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

I am currently involved in two exciting projects that push the boundaries of machine learning and optimization:

- **Large Language Model for Investor Engagement**: In collaboration with BNP Asset Management, I am developing a specialized large language model (LLM) designed to explain optimization model results in a way that is accessible and engaging for investors. This project aims to bridge the gap between complex model outputs and investor insights.
