**🧠 AI Research · ENS Paris-Saclay (MVA) & CentraleSupélec** Generative Models · Representation Learning  ⚙️

MSc in Mathematics, Vision & Learning (MVA) with a background in applied mathematics and data science.

I work on **generative models and representation learning**, with a bias toward building systems that actually run; clean experiments, reproducible pipelines, honest benchmarks.

Currently finishing my master's and looking for **Applied Scientist / Research Engineering** roles in foundation models or generative AI 🚀


## 🔬 Research Interests

### 🌊 Diffusion models & noise geometry

Replacing IID Gaussian noise with **structured processes** (Simplex, Matérn, rank-based Gaussianization) to control denoising difficulty and improve anomaly separability.

Building principled diagnostics to understand *why* noise geometry shifts AUROC — not just that it does.

---

### 🧩 Representation learning

Probing internal feature geometry in Transformers and GNNs via **t-SNE, PPCA, KL trajectories**.

Interested in when and how representations become interpretable across layers.
